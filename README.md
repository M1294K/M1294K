## Hi there 👋

I'm **M1294K**, an aspiring **Software Engineer** currently in my **2nd year of university**.

I enjoy exploring different areas of software development, and I'm always trying new technologies and building things from scratch — whether it's web **backends**, frontends, algorithms, or even game prototypes.
I'm learning and experimenting a lot — trying out various stacks and figuring out what kind of engineer I want to become.

----
**Tools & Tech**
* Backend: Node.js, Express, Spring Boot(Java, Kotlin), MySQL
* Frontend(weak): React  <br/>
